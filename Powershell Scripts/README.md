## Powershell & VBS Scripts

A few scripts that I created using PowerShell and VBS:

| Script Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| **CredGuard_Check.ps1** | This script determines if Credential Guard is Configured and/or Running. |
| **GetTier0.ps1** | This script returns all users and groups considered to be a part of Tier 0. Following this, it looks for the workstations they can Log in from based on the Logonworkstation AD attribute.  |
| **windowsWget.vbs** | Wget script based on OSCP notes. |
