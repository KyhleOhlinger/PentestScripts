# PentestScripts
This GIT Repository will serve as a collaborative effort for penteration testing scripts, tools, and anything else that I have created, addapter, or found interesting.

* If you want to use the scripts or add your own, please do so. 
* If you want to alter scripts, please provide insight into why you think an alteration could help the script.

This repo is divided into the following Subsections:
## Python Scripts

- **automation.py:** This script is for automated host scanning using python. It includes a variety of Kali based scans to determine relevant information about a specific host.
- **ntlm.py:** This script converts a plaintext password to an NTLM password.

## Powershell Scripts

- **CredGuard_Check.ps1:** This script determines if Credential Guard is Configured and/or Running.

## Bash Scripts

These scripts were created during the set up of various challenge VM's:

- **portRotation.sh:** This script automatically rotates ports while broadcasting a message on a random port (It requires UFW for opening and closing ports).           
- **startUp.sh:** This script opens and closes ports on startup. It includes functionality for opening and closing ports based on a specific trigger event such as accessing a specific port.
- **Network.sh:** Re-establishes Linux network adapter.
- **LDAP.sh:** This script contains basic and more advanced LDAP enumeration queries.
- **SMBShares.sh:** This scipt finds open SMB ports from an IP Range and provides commands which the list can be fed into.
