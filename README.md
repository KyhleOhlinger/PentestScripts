# PentestScripts
This GIT Repository will serve as a collaborative effort for penteration testing scripts, tools, and anything else that I have created, adapted, or found interesting.

* If you want to use the scripts or add your own, please do so. 
* If you want to alter scripts, please provide insight into why you think an alteration could help the script.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file with basic descriptions for each script. I will continue adding to this repo when I get time.
