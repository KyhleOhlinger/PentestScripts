# PentestScripts
This GIT Repository will serve as a collaborative effort for penteration testing scripts, tools, and anything else that I have created, adapted, or found interesting.

* If you want to use the scripts or add your own, please do so. 
* If you want to alter scripts, please provide insight into why you think an alteration could help the script.

This repo is divided into the following Subsections:
## Python Scripts
### Mostly Linux & Web App Pentesting
- **automation.py:** This script is for automated host scanning using python. It includes a variety of Kali based scans to determine relevant information about a specific host.
- **nslookup.py:** An automated scanner that can be used during network assessments in order to determine the available hosts and open ports for the given hosts.
- **portSploit.py:** An automated exploitation tool that can be used during a web application and infrastructure penetration tests to determine the exploitable ports for a given IP.
- **template.py:** Basic template for the _automation.py_, _nslookup.py_, and _portSploit.py_ files.

- **portRotation.py:** This script automatically rotates ports while broadcasting a message on a random port (It requires UFW for opening and closing ports). Useful for creating Vulnerable VMs. 
- **proxy.py:** This is a basic python template for API testing.

### Mostly AD Pentesting
- **neo4jWrapper.py:** Basic wrapper for Neo4J and Bloodhound in order to run Cypher queries via command line.
- **ntlm.py:** This script converts a plaintext password to an NTLM password.
- **ACL_Check.py:** This script returns data from BloodHound where an object has ACL control over another object and the object is not part of Tier 0. Additionally it provides a perfect list of direct Tier0 members and groups. ACL_Check_With_LaTeX_Output.py includes an option to output the results in ShareLaTeX format.

## Powershell & VBS Scripts

- **CredGuard_Check.ps1:** This script determines if Credential Guard is Configured and/or Running.
- **GetTier0.ps1:** This script returns all users and groups considered to be a part of Tier 0. Following this, it looks for the workstations they can Log in from based on the Logonworkstation AD attribute. 
- **windowsWget.vbs:** Wget script based on OSCP notes

## Bash Scripts

These scripts were created for Network Pentests:
- **Network.sh:** Re-establishes Linux network adapter.
- **LDAP.sh:** This script contains basic and more advanced LDAP enumeration queries.
- **SMBShares.sh:** This scipt finds open SMB ports from an IP Range and provides commands which the list can be fed into.
- **Zone.sh:** Basic zone transfer script

## Golang Scripts

- **RevShell.go:** Basic Linux Reverse Shell
- **Recon.go:** Windows recon script for host, AV, and user enumeration 
- **RegEditor.go:** Add a path/executables to the Windows Defender registry exclusions list

## Misc Scripts

A bunch of scripts that are just for fun

- **EmailScraper:** Basic GreaseMonkey Script for scraping email addresses from a webpage
