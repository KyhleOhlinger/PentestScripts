# Ansible Playbooks

In order to run a playbook on a host, you will need to have Ansible installed - From there, you can run the playbook using the following command:

```bat
ansible-playbook <playbook_name>
```

The Ansible playbooks that I created are described below:

| Playbook | Description|
| -- | -- |
| **recon_playbook.yml** | Playbook based on the [Bug Hunters Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4JgIu1mceI). It is an automated script to pull the relevant GitHub repositories and put them into a Recon directory. |
