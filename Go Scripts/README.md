## Golang Scripts

- **RevShell.go:** Basic Linux Reverse Shell
- **Recon.go:** Windows recon script for host, AV, and user enumeration 
- **RegEditor.go:** Add a path/executables to the Windows Defender registry exclusions list


## Recon.go

A GO script with build in reverse shell capabilities. It pulls user, host, antivirus, and architecture information. You can compile the project code using:
  
`go build -ldflags "-H=windowsgui" env GOOS=Windows GOARCH=386 Recon.go`

The `-ldflags "-H=windowsgui"` flag hides the CMD window while executing. 

#### Netcat Capabilities
The project opens a TCP connection to a host which you control in order to retrieve the information without writting any information to disk on the compromised workstation. Before building the project, replace `<IP>` and `<PORT>` with the 
required values.

## RegEditor.go

A GO script which will add a binary path to the Windows Defender registry in order to exclude it from scanning a payload. In essence it will perform the same function as PowerShell's Mp-AddPreference. Still a WIP due to compatiability issues, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35730#issuecomment-558228731) 

## RevShell.go

A GO script which contains basic reverse shell capabilities. You can compile the project code using:
  
`go build RevShell.go`

Additionally, [Rev2Go](https://github.com/sathish09/rev2go) has a great table with which shows the possible combinations of GOOS and GOARCH you can use when compiling a GO executable.

#### Netcat Capabilities
The project opens a TCP connection to a host which you control in order to retrieve the information without writting any information to disk on the compromised workstation. Before building the project, replace `<IP>` and `<PORT>` with the required values.

## Host Enumeration
After obtaining an initial foothold on the machine, the following commands can be used for basic enumeration of the hosts:

#### Linux
`echo " ";echo "uname -a:";uname -a;echo " ";echo "hostname:";hostname;echo " ";echo "id";id;echo " ";echo "ifconfig:";/sbin/ifconfig -a; echo " ";echo "groups:";groups;`

#### Windows
`echo. & echo. & echo whoami: & whoami 2> nul & echo %username% 2> nul & echo. & echo Hostname: & hostname & echo. & ipconfig /all`
